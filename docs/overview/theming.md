# Theming

Surge is built with TailwindCSS, and the _majority_ of styling can be completely customized by modifying the `tailwind.config.js` file. This file is located in the root of the project, and is used to define the theme colors, fonts, and other styles used throughout the project. More complex styles can be modified in the `app.css` file, which uses Tailwind's apply utility.

## Colours
Surge is opinionated, and so the colour system continues this. There are several colours defined which are linked for verbosity.
